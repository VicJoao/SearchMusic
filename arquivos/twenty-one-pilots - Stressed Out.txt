I wish I found some better sounds
No one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice
That sang some better words
I wish I found some chords
In an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to
Rhyme every time I sang

I was told when I get older
All my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure
And I care what people think

My name's blurryface
And I care what you think
My name's blurryface
And I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time,
To the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep,
But now we're stressed out
Wish we could turn back time,
To the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep,
But now we're stressed out

We're stressed out

Sometimes a certain smell
Will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to
Identify where it's coming from?
I'd make a candle out of it
If I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it,
I'd probably only sell one

It'd be to my brother,
'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, homegrown,
A stone's throw from a creek
We used to roam
But it would remind us
Of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans
And treehouse homes
We all would take the latter

My name's blurryface
And I care what you think
My name's blurryface
And I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time,
To the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep,
But now we're stressed out
Wish we could turn back time,
To the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep,
But now we're stressed out

We used to play pretend,
Give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship
And then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space,
But now they're laughing at our face
Saying: wake up, you need to make money
Yo

We used to play pretend,
Give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship
And then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space
But now they're laughing at our face
Saying: wake up, you need to make money
Yo

Wish we could turn back time,
To the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep,
But now we're stressed out
Wish we could turn back time,
To the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep,
But now we're stressed out

Used to play pretend,
Used to play pretend, bunny
We used to play pretend,
Wake up, you need the money
Used to play pretend,
Used to play pretend, bunny
We used to play pretend,
Wake up, you need the money
We used to play pretend,
Give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship
And then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space
But now they're laughing at our face
Saying: wake up, you need to make money
Yo
