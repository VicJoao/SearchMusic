He stays home from work this time
He never really told his wife
He never really told a lie
But this time he decides that it's alright
It's alright

No one really knows his mind
And no one knows behind his eyes
The man deserves a medal but
He's never really won a prize before
He goes to lock the door

He is falling in love
He knows it's enough
And the world looks down and frowns

Get up, Johnny Boy
Get up, Johnny Boy
Get up, cause the world
has left you lying on the ground
You're my pride and joy
you're my pride and joy
Get up, Johnny Boy
Because we all need you now

Someone said "Where are you going?"
Someone said to you "Goodbye"
They deflect the disrespect
When they say that they blame it on the times
Blame it on times

We all know you're qualified
To fix a chair and love your wife
They all know you're qualified
But they lie when they blame it on the times
Oh, they blame it on the times

He has fallen in love
He knows it's enough
But the world looks down and frowns

Get up, Johnny Boy
Get up, Johnny Boy
Get up, cause the world
has left you lying on the ground
You're my pride and joy
you're my pride and joy
Get up, Johnny Boy
Because we all need you now
We all need you now

I will carry all your names
And I will carry all your shame
And I will carry all your names
And I will carry all your shame
And I will carry all your names
And I will carry all your shame

Get up, Johnny Boy
Get up, Johnny Boy
Get up, cause the world
has left you lying on the ground
You're my pride and joy
you're my pride and joy
Get up, Johnny Boy
Because we all need you now

Get up, Johnny Boy
Get up, Johnny Boy
Get up, cause the world
has left you lying on the ground
You're my pride and joy
you're my pride and joy
Get up, Johnny Boy
Because we all need you now
