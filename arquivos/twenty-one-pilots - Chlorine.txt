Sippin' on straight chlorine
Let the vibe slide over me
This beat is a chemical
Beat is a chemical
When I leave don't save my seat
I'll be back when it's all complete
The moment is medical
Moment is medical
Sippin' on straight chlorine

Lovin' what I'm tasting
Venom on my tongue
Dependent at times
Poisonous vibrations
Help my body run

I'm runnin' for my life
Runnin' for my life

Sippin' on straight chlorine
Let the vibe slide over me
This beat is a chemical
Beat is a chemical
When I leave don't save my seat
I'll be back when it's all complete
The moment is medical
Moment is medical
Sippin' on straight chlorine

Fall out of formation
I plan my escape
From walls they confined
Rebel red carnation
Grows while I decay

I'm runnin' for my life
Runnin' for my life
Yeah, I'm runnin' for my life
Runnin' for my life

Hide you in my coat pocket
Where I kept my rebel red
I Felt I was invincible
You wrapped around my head
Now different lives I lead
My body lives on lead
The last two lines may read
Incorrect until said
The lead is terrible in flavor
But now you double as a paper maker
I despise you sometimes
I love to hate the fight
And you in my life is like

Sippin' on straight chlorine
Let the vibe slide over me
This beat is a chemical
Beat is a chemical
When I leave don't save my seat
I'll be back when it's all complete
The moment is medical
Moment is medical
Sippin' on straight chlorine

(Let the vibe, let the vibe)
(Let the vibe, let the vibe)
(Beat is a chemical)
(Let the vibe, let the vibe)
(Let the vibe, let the vibe)
(Moment is medical)
Sippin' on straight chlorine
(Let the vibe, let the vibe)
(Let the vibe, let the vibe)
(Beat is a chemical, yeah)
(Let the vibe, let the vibe)
(Let the vibe, let the vibe)
(Moment is medical, yeah)

I'm so sorry, I forgot you
Let me catch you up to speed
I've been tested like the ends of
A weathered flag that's by the sea

Can you build my house with pieces?
I'm just a chemical
Can you build my house with pieces?
I'm just a chemical
Can you build my house with pieces?
I'm just a chemical
Can you build my house with pieces?
I'm just a chemical
