Everyone's feeling pretty
It's hotter than July
Though the world's full of problems
They couldn't touch us even if they tried

From the park I hear rhythms
Marley's hot on the box
Tonight there will be a party
On the corner at the end of the block

Didn't know you
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
I bet nobody ever told you that you
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
You would be jammin' and jammin' and jammin', jam on

They want us to join their fighting
But our answer today
Is to let all our worries
Like the breeze through our fingers slip away

Peace has come to Zimbabwe
Third world's right on the one
Now's the time for celebration
'Cause we've only just begun

Didn't know you
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Bet nobody ever told you that you
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn?

Did nobody ever tell you that you
(We're in the middle of the makin's
of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn?

I know nobody ever told you that you
(We're in the middle of the makin's
of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
We're jammin', jammin', jammin', jam on
