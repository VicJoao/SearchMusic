You've got that look again
The one I hoped I had when I was a lad
Your face is just beaming
Your smile got me boasting
My pulse roller-coastering

Anyway the four winds that blow
They're gonna send me sailing home to you
Or I'll fly with the force of a rainbow
The dream of gold will be waiting in your eyes

You know I'd do most anything you want
Hey, I, I try to give you everything you need
I can see that it gets to you

I don't believe in many things
But in you, I do

Her faith is amazing
The pain that she goes through
Contained in the hope for you
Your whole world has changed
The years spent before
Seem more cloudy than blue

In many ways your baby's controlling
When you haven't laid down for days
For the poor no time to be thinking
They're too busy finding ways

And I
You know I'd do most anything you want
Hey, I, I try to give you everything you need
I see that it gets to you

I don't believe in many things
But in you

I don't believe in many things
But in you

Oh, I don't believe
I don't believe in many things
But in you, I do
