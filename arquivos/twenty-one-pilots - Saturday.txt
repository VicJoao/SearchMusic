Slow down on Monday
Not a sound on Wednesday
Might get loud on Friday
But on Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
We paint the town

Lose my sense a time or two
Weeks feel like days
Medicate in the afternoon
And I just want to know
Have you lost your footing too?
I just pray that I'm not losing you

Catch me floating circles in my fish bowl
Keep things fresh
She said that I should change my clothes
I exaggerate the life we used to know

Slow down on Monday
Not a sound on Wednesday
Might get loud on Friday
But on Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
We paint the town

Ooh you're good
These are my dancing shoes
We paint the town
Ooh you're good
Thought I would dance with you
Might get loud on Friday
But on Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
We paint the town

(Feeling great)
Life moves slow on the ocean floor
(Feeling great)
I can't feel the waves anymore
Did the tide forget to move?
I just pray that I'm not losing you

Catch me floating circles in my fish bowl
Keep things fresh
She said that I should change my clothes
I exaggerate the life we used to know

Slow down on Monday
Not a sound on Wednesday
Might get loud on Friday
But on Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
We paint the town
