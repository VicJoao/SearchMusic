Don't let them fool, ya
Or even try to school, ya! Oh, no!
We've got a mind of our own
So go to hell if what you? re thinking is not right!
Love would never leave us alone
A-yin the darkness there must come out to light

Could you be loved and be loved?
Could you be loved and be loved?

Don't let them change ya, oh!
Or even rearrange ya! Oh, no!
We've got a life to live
They say: only, only
Only the fittest of the fittest shall survive
Stay alive! Oh!

Could you be loved and be loved?
Could you be loved, wo now! And be loved?

Could you be
Could you be
Could you be loved?

Say something!

Se ligue na ternura
Se ligue no amor
Se ligue na ternura
Se ligue na cor
Se ligue na alegria
Se ligue no prazer
Se ligue, fique atento, se ligue, fique astral

Could you be loved and be loved?
