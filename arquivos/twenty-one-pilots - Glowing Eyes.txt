We all are stranger creatures
than when we all started out as kids
Culture forbids
We have romantic fantasies about what
dying truly is
To fall off the grid

We live of night's decor
It reveals what we dream for the

I know there's someone at the door
They called for help, of this I'm sure
But do I want to say goodbye to all the glowing eyes
I'm holding on to what I know,
And what I know, I must let go
But I would rather play a song
for the eyes to sing along
For the eyes to sing along-long-long

We all know somebody who knows somebody who's doing great
I know some people who know people who are
flying straight
But I'll kindly enter in to rooms of depression
While ceiling fans and idle hands
will take my life again

I know there's someone at the door
They called for help, of this I'm sure
But do I want to say goodbye
to all the glowing eyes
I'm holding on to what I know,
And what I know, I must let go
But I would rather play a song
for the eyes to sing along

This room is far too dark for us to stay around
Redemption's not that far and darkness is going down
This room is far too dark for us to stay around
Redemption's not that far and darkness is going down
