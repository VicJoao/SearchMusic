I don't know why
I just feel I'm
Better off
Staying in the same room I was born in
I look outside
And see a whole world
Better off
Without me in it
Trying to transform it

You are out of my mind (oh)
You aren't seeing my side (oh)
You waste all this time
Trying to get to me
But you
are out of my mind (yeah)

Listen I know
this one is a contradiction because of how happy it sounds
But the lyrics are so down
It's okay though
Because it represents--wait better yet--it is
Who I feel I am
Right now

You are out of my mind (oh)
You aren't seeing my side (oh)
You waste all this time
Trying to get to me
But you
are out of my mind (yeah)

Heard you say, not today, tore the curtains down
Windows open I'll make a sound
Heard your voice, there's no choice
Tore the curtains down, windows open I'll make a noise

(Ohh!)
Don't you test me though
Just because I play the piano
Doesn't mean I
am not willing to take you down
(I'm sorry)

I'm, I'm out of my mind (oh)
I'm not seeing things right (oh)
I waste all this time
Trying to run from you
But I'm
out of my mind

Heard you say, not today, tore the curtains down
Windows open I'll make a sound
Heard your voice, there's no choice
Tore the curtains down, windows open I'll make a noise

(OOh, ooh, yeah, ohh,) x2

You are out of my mind
You aren't seeing my side
You waste all this time trying to get to me
But you
are out of my mind

Heard you say, not today, tore the curtains down
Windows open I'll make a sound
Heard your voice, there's no choice
Tore the curtains down, windows open I'll make a noise

(Ba, ba, ba, not today, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba,)
