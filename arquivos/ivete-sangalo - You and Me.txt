Junte suas coisas, o que precisar
Me dê sua mão e vamos sumir
Nosso caminho por terra ou mar
Nada mais me importa
Vamos embora daqui

E quando a gente cruzar o horizonte
É que vamos saber o motivo de ir
Vamos saber o motivo de ir

Oh and when the kids
Are old enough
We will teach them
To fly

You and me together
We can do anything baby
You and me together
Yes, yes

Two of us together
We could do anything baby
You and me together
Yes, yes

You and I
We?re not tied
To the ground
Not falling but rising
Like rolling around

Duas vidas pulsando num só coração
Vamos sem destino andar por aí
Nem tente entender
Só depois do horizonte é que vamos
Saber o motivo de ir
O motivo de ir

Oh and when the kids
Are old enough
We will teach
Them to fly

You and me together
We could do anything baby
You and me together
Yes, yes

Two of us together
We could do anything baby
You and me together
Yeah, yeah

We can always look back
At what we did
Always the memory of
You and me baby

But right now it?s
You and me
Forever girl

You know
We could do better then
Anything that we did
You know that
You and me
We could do anything

We could do anything

You and me together
Could do anything baby
You and me together
Yeah, yeah

The two of us together
Could do anything baby
You and me together
Yes, yes

Two of us together
Could do anything baby
You and me together
Could do anything baby

Something small
?Till you reach
The end of the world
