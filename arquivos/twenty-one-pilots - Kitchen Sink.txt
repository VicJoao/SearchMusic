Nobody thinks what I think
Nobody dreams when they blink
Think things on the brink of blasphemy
I'm my own shrink
Think things are after me
My catastrophe
I'm a kitchen sink
You don't know what that means
Because a kitchen sink to you
Is not a kitchen sink to me
Ok, friend?
Are you searching for purpose?
Then write something
Yeah it might be worthless
Then paint something
It might be wordless
Pointless curses
Nonsense verses
You'll see purpose start to surface
No one else is dealing with your demons
Meaning maybe defeating them
Could be the beginning of your meaning
Friend

Go away [x4]
Leave me alone [x4]

Nobody thinks what you think
No one
Empathy might be on the brink of extinction
They will play a game and say
They know what you're going through
And I tried to come up
With an artistic way to say
They don't know you
And neither do I
So here's a prime example of a stand up guy
Who hates what he believes
And loves it at the same time
Here's my brother and his head's screwed up
But that's alright

Time gains momentum
The moment when I'm living in 'em
I'm winning a momentary
Sinning a moment passing after
Re-beginning moments
Mending memories
Pretending enemies are frenemies
Sending me straight to bending me
My bad behavior
But I bet
I could have been a better man
Copy and paste caught me
And copy
Better rhymes bother me
The better the rhythm
The badder I am but
I bet I'll battle
With 'em battle better I am
Gambling man
Better bet I am a gambling man
I am?

Go away [x4]
Leave me alone [x5]

Don't leave me alone
