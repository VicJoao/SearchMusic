I don't wanna fall, fall away
I don't wanna fall, fall away
I'll keep the lights on in this place
Cause I don't wanna fall, fall away


I disguise
And I will lie
And I will take my precious time
As the days melt away
As I stand in line
And I die as I wait
As I wait on my crime
And I'll try to delay what
you make of my life
But I don't want your way
I want mine
I'm dying and trying
But believe me I'm fine
But I'm lying
I'm so very far from fine


And I
I can feel the pull begin
I feel my conscience wearing thin
And my skin
It will start to break up and fall apart

I don't wanna fall, fall away
I don't wanna fall, fall away
I'll keep the lights on in this place
Cause I don't wanna fall, fall away


Every time I feel selfish ambition
Is taking my vision
And my crime is my sentence
Repentance is taking commision
It's taking a toll
On my soul
I'm screaming submission and
I don't know if I am dying or living
Cause I will save face
For name's sake
Abuse grace
Take aim to obtain a new name
And a newer place
But my name is lame
I can't walk and I ain't the same
And my name became
A new destiny to the grave


And I
I can feel the pull begin
Feel my conscience wearing thin
And my skin
It will start to break up and fall apart

I don't wanna fall, fall away
I don't wanna fall, fall away
I'll keep the lights on in this place
Cause I don't wanna fall, fall away
