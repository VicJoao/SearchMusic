Hey, hey
Wouldn't it be
Great, great
If we could just
Lay down
And wake up in
Slowtown

Today, 'day
I wanna go
Away, 'way
'cause things are too
Fast now
I wanna be in
Slowtown

I put my socks on
My feet
Just so that
My sole won't
Fall through
My toes

And I walk
Through my door
Just so
I don't
Fall through
The floor

I remember when
My brother
And other kids
From neighboring houses
Would get together
I'd ride my bike
And my brother would ride his
Put cards in our spokes
And make our engines
Sound like choffing
When using pok√©mon cards please
Do not use a holographic
So bold and fearless
And the risks we'd take
Laugh in the face
Of gravity as its laws
We'd break
On trampolines so high
We reach for the sky
But I do not
Look up anymore
And I don't why

I put my socks on
My feet
Just so that
My sole won't
Fall through
My toes

And I walk
Through my door
Just so
I don't
Fall through
The floor

We're going too
Fast, fast
Save us

We're going too
Fast, fast
Save us

We're going too
Fast, fast
Save us now

We're going too
Fast, fast
Save us

We're going too
Fast, fast
Save us

We're going too
Fast, fast
Save us now

I walk through
My door
Just so
I don't
Fall through
The floor

Hey, hey
Wouldn't it be
Great, great
If we could just
Lay down
and wake up in
Slowtown
