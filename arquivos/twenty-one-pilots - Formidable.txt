You are formidable to me
'Cause you seem to know it where you wanna go
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll follow you

But you should know I might be cynical towards you
But I just can't believe that I'm for you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can die with you
Just let me know (yeah)

And I know that we just met
But could you take me everywhere you've ever been?
I wanna see it all, no surprises (yeah)

You are formidable to me
'Cause you seem to know it where you wanna go
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll follow you

But you should know I might bе clinical, don't you tell
I won't break your heart if you can brеak my spell
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can die with you
Just let me know

Fast-forward thirteen years now
Don't know what it was, but somehow we played it out in reverse
I'm afraid of you now, more than I was at first
And I know you just left, but can I take you everywhere we've ever been?
I wanna see it all, no surprises (yeah)

You are formidable to me
'Cause you seem to know it where you wanna go
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll follow you

But you should know I might be cynical towards you
I'm just worried my loyalty will bore you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can die with you
Just let me know

Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can die with you
Just let me know
