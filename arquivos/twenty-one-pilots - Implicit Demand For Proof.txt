I know you're not a liar and
I know you could set fire this day
Go ahead and make me look away

Strike me down, I am calling your lightning
Down from your dark hiding place
Go ahead and show me your face

Rain down and destroy me
Rain down and destroy me
Rain down

I mean no disrespect
I am simply
Very perplexed by your ways
Why won't you let us use your name?

Rain down and destroy me
Rain down and destroy me
Rain down and destroy me
Rain down and destroy me

Down, rain
Down
