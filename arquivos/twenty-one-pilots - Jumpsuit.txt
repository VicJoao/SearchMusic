I can't believe how much I hate
Pressures of a new place roll my way
Jumpsuit, Jumpsuit cover me
Jumpsuit, Jumpsuit cover me
I crumble underneath the weight
Pressures of a new place roll my way
Jumpsuit, Jumpsuit cover me
Jumpsuit, Jumpsuit cover me

Spirits in my room, friend or foe?
Felt it in my youth, feel it when I'm old
Jumpsuit, Jumpsuit cover me
Dusting off my Jumpsuit

I can't believe how much I hate
Pressures of a new place roll my way
Jumpsuit, Jumpsuit cover me
Jumpsuit, Jumpsuit cover me

I'll be right there
But you'll have to grab my throat and lift me in the air
If you need anyone
I'll stop my plans
But you'll have to tie me down and then break both my hands
If you need anyone

I'll be right there
But you'll have to grab my throat and lift me in the air
If you need anyone
If you need anyone
If you need anyone
If you need anyone

I can't believe how much I hate
Pressures of a new place roll my way
Jumpsuit, Jumpsuit cover me
Jumpsuit, Jumpsuit cover me

Jumpsuit, Jumpsuit cover me
Jumpsuit, Jumpsuit cover me
