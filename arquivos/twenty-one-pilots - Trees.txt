I know where you stand
Silent in the trees
And that's where I am
Silent in the trees

Why won't you speak?
Where I happen to be
Silent in the trees
Standing cowardly

I can feel your breath
I can feel my death
I want to know you
I want to see
I want to say
Hello
Hello
Hello-o-o
Hello

Da da
Da da da da da

I know where you stand
Silent in the trees
And that's where I am
Silent in the trees

Why won't you speak?
Where I happen to be
Silent in the trees
Standing cowardly

I can feel your breath
I can feel my death
I want to know you
I want to see
I want to say
Hello
Hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Yeah

Hello, hello
Hello, hello
