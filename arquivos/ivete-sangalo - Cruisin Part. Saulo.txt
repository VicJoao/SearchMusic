Baby, let's cruise, away from here
Don't be confused, the way is clear
And if you want it you got it forever
This is not a one night stand, baby

Let the music take your mind
Just release & you will find
You're gonna fly away
Glad you're goin' my way
I love it when we're cruisin' together
Music is played for love
Cruisin' is made for love
I love it when we're cruisin' together

Baby, tonight belongs to us
Everything's right, do what you must
And inch by inch we get closer & closer

To every little part of each other, ooh, baby, yeah, so

Let the music take your mind
Just release & you will find
You're gonna fly away
Glad you're going my way
I love it when we're cruisin' together
Music is played for love
Cruisin' is made for love
I love it when we're cruisin' together

You're gonna fly away

Cruise with me, baby
