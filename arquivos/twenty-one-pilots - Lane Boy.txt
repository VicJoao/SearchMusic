They say stay in your lane boy, lane boy
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?

They think this thing is a highway, if it was our way
We'd have a tempo change every other time change
Cause our minds change, on what we think is good
I wasn't raised in the hood
But I know a thing or two about pain and darkness
If it wasn't for this music
I don't know how I would've fought this

Regardless, all these songs
I'm hearing are so heartless
Don't trust a perfect person
And don't trust a song that's flawless
Honest, there's a few songs
On this record that feel common

I'm in constant confrontation
With what I want and what is poppin'
In the industry it seems to me
That singles on the radio are currency
My creativity is only free when I'm playin' shows
They say stay in your lane boy, lane boy
But we go where we want to

They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?
Will they be alive tomorrow?
I'm sorry if that question
I asked last, scared you a bit like a hazmat
In a gas mask, if you ask zack
He's my brother, he likes when I rap fast

But let's back track, back to this
Who would you live and die for on that list
But the problem is, there's another list
That exist and no one really wants to think about this
Forget sanity, forget salary, forget vanity, my morality
If you get in between someone
I love and me, you're gonna feel the heat of my calvary
All these songs I'm hearing are so heartless
Don't trust a perfect person and don't trust a song that's flawless

They say stay in your lane boy, lane boy
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow
They say stay in your lane boy, lane boy
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow
Will they be alive tomorrow?
(Will they be alive tomorrow?)

They say stay in your lane boy, lane boy
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow
They say stay in your lane boy, lane boy
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow
