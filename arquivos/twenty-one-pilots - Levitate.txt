Oh, I know how to levitate up off my feet
And ever since the seventh grade
I've learned to fire-breathe
And though I feed on things that fell
You can learn to levitate with just a little help
Learn to levitate with just a little help

Come down, dome down
Cowards only come through when the hour's late
and everyone's asleep, mind you, now
Show up, show up
I know I shouldn't say this but a curse from you
is all that I would need right now, man

Come down, dome down
Cowards only come through when the hour's late
and everyone's asleep, mind you, now
Show up, show up
I know I shouldn't say this but a curse from you
is all that I would need right now, man

Danger in the fabric of this thing I made
I probably shouldn't show you, but it's way too late
My heart is with you, hiding
but my mind's not made
Now they know what you and me both have for some time
I'd say

They're smirking at fresh blood
They're circling above
But this is not enough
Yeah, this is not what you thought
No, we are not just graffiti on a passing train
I got back what I once bought back in that slot
I won't need to replace

This culture is a poacher of overexposure
Not today, don't feed me to the vultures
I am a vulture who feeds on pain

Sleep in a well-lit room
Don't let the shadow through
And sever all I knew
Yeah sever all I thought

I thought I could depend on, my weekends
On the freezing ground that I'm sleeping on
Please keep me from
please keep me down from the ledges
Better test it
wooden wedges under doorways
Keep your wooden wedges under doors

Chorus, verse, chorus, verse
Now here comes the eight
Wait, habits here too
You're the worst, your structure compensates
But compensation feels a lot like rising up
to dominate
By track two, at least they all know
all they hear comes from a place

Oh I know how to levitate up off my feet
And ever since the seventh grade
I learned to fire-breathe
And though I feed on things that fell
You can learn to levitate with just a little help
You can levitate with just a little help
