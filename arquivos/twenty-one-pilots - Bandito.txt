I could take the high road
But I know that I'm going low
I'm a ban- I'm a bandito

This is the sound we make
When in between two places
Where we used to bleed
And where our blood needs to be

I could take the high road
But I know that I'm going low
I'm a ban- I'm a bandito

In City I feel my spirit is contained
Like neon inside the glass
They form my brain
But I recently discovered
It's a heartless fire
Like nicknames they give themselves to uninspire
Began with bullet
Now add fire to the proof
But I'm still not sure if fear's a rival
Or close relative to truth
Either way it helps to hear these words bounce off of you
The softest echo could be enough for me to make it through

Sahlo Folina

I created this world
To feel some control
Destroy it if I want
So I sing Sahlo Folina
