When I get home
You better not be there
We're placing bets you won't shed your modesty
And the only thing to leave behind
Is your own skin on the floor

Don't you shy away
Manifest a ceiling when you shy away
Searching for that feeling
Just like an 'I Love You'
That isn't words
Like a song he wrote
that's never heard
Don't you shh

When you get home
You barely recognize the pictures they
put in a frame
'Cause you shed your modesty
Don't circle the track
Take what you have
and leave your skin on the floor

Don't you shy away
Manifest a ceiling when you shy away
Searching for that feeling
Just like an 'I Love You'
That isn't words
Like a song he wrote
that's never heard

When I get home
Boy, you better not be there
You're long gone
Shed your modesty
Don't circle the track
Just break the cycle in half
and leave your skin on the floor

Don't you shy away
Manifest a ceiling when you shy away
Searching for that feeling
Just like an 'I Love You'
That isn't words
Like a song he wrote
that's never heard

that's never heard

An 'I Love You'
That isn't words
Like a song he wrote
that's never heard

Don't you shy away
