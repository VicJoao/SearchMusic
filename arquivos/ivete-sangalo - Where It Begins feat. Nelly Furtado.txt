When you're alone and you don't know how,
To fill the hole inside your heart.
Don't be afraid and hide in yesterday,
The best in your life is yet to come.

Open your world to me,
There's always room for love.

Look around, can't you feel?
All the love, it's all that you need.
Breathing out, breathing in,
No one knows where it all ends and...

Look around, can't you feel?
All the love, it's all that you need.
Breathing out, breathing in,
No one knows where it all ends and where it begins.
Where it begins!

When you have tried your very best.
And it's not enough, it's OK.
There'll be a chance to be strong again,
Another light will guide your way.

Open your heart to me,
Give me all of your love.

Look around, can't you feel?
All the love, it's all that we need.
Breathing out, breathing in,
No one knows where it all ends and...

Look around, can't you feel?
All the love, it's all that we need.
Breathing out, breathing in,
No one knows where it all ends and where it begins.
Where it begins!

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

Look around, can't you feel?
All the love, it's all that you need.
Breathing out, breathing in,
No one knows where it all ends and...

Look around, can't you feel?
All the love, it's all that you need.
Breathing out, breathing in,
No one knows where it all ends and where it begins!
