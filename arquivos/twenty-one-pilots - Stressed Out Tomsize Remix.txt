I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang

I was told when I get older all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure and I care what people think
My name's 'blurryface' and I care what you think
My name's 'blurryface' and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time, to the good ol' days
When our momma sang us to sleep
But now we're stressed out

Now we're stressed out

Sometimes a certain smell will
Take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's coming from
I'd make a candle out of it if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes homegrown, a stone's
Throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and treehouse
Homes we all would take the latter

My name's 'blurryface' and I care what you think
My name's 'blurryface' and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time, to the good ol' days
When our momma sang us to sleep
But now we're stressed out

Now we're stressed out

We used to play pretend
Give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space
But now they're laughing at our face
Saying, "wake up, you need to make money"

We used to play pretend
Give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space
But now they're laughing at our face
Saying, "wake up, you need to make money"

Wish we could turn back time, to the good ol' days
When our momma sang us to sleep
But now we're stressed out

Wish we could turn back time, to the good ol' days
When our momma sang us to sleep
But now we're stressed out

We used to play pretend
Used to play pretend (money)
We used to play pretend
Wake up you need the money
We used to play pretend
Used to play pretend (money)
We used to play pretend
Wake up you need the money

We used to play pretend
Give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space
But now they're laughing at our face
Saying, "wake up, you need to make money"
