I won't take much of your time
I just want you to see
What I have made inside these lines
It's as good as I can be
It's as good as I can be
This is all that I can be
This is all that I can be
All that I can be

Head tilted down, knees on the ground
I will ask
Please...
Save-me!

Please save,
Save!
save, save, save, save, save, save, save, save
save, save, save-me
save-me, save-me, save-me

I deserve for you to turn away
I was ashamed to speak your name
I can't believe that all you see is
That you have covered me gracefully
You're all I want to be
You're all I want to be
You're all I ever needed
You're all I ever needed

Jesus, Jesus...
Please...
Save-me!

Please save,
Save!
save, save, save, save, save, save, save, save
save, save, save-me
save-me, save-me, save-me

I won't take much of your time
But just enought for you to save me
