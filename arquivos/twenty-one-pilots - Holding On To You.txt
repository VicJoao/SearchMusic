I'm taking over my body, back in control, no more shotty
I bet a lot of me was lost
't's uncrossed and 'I's undotted
I fought it a lot and it seems a lot like flesh is all I got
Not anymore, flesh out the door, swat
I must've forgot, you can't trust me
I'm open a moment and close when you show it
Before you know it I'm lost at sea
And now that I write and think about it
And the story unfolds
You should take my life, you should take my soul

You are surrounding all my surroundings
Sounding down the mountain range
Of my left-side brain
You are surrounding all my surroundings
Twisting the kaleidoscope behind both of my eyes

And I'll be holding on to you

Remember the moment
You know exactly where you're going
'Cause the next moment, before you know it
Time is slowing and it's frozen still
And the window sill looks really nice, right?
You think twice about your life
It probably happens at night, right?

Fight it, take the pain, ignite it
Tie a noose around your mind loose
Enough to breathe fine and tie it
To a tree, tell it
"You belong to me
This ain't a noose, this is a leash
And I have news for you: you must obey me. "

You are surrounding all my surroundings
Sounding down the mountain range
Of my left-side brain
You are surrounding all my surroundings
Twisting the kaleidoscope behind both of my eyes

Entertain my faith (10x)

Lean with it, rock with it
When we gonna stop with it
Lyrics that mean nothing
We were gifted with thought
Is it time to move our feet to an introspective beat
It ain't the speakers that bump hearts
It's our hearts that make the beat

And I'll be holding on to you (8x)
