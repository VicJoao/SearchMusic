I'll keep on trying
Might as well
If you decide
All is well
Though I am bruised
Face of contusions
Know I'll keep moving

Rust around the rim
Drink it anyway
I cut my lip
Isn't what I want
Blood is on my tongue
I cut my lip

I keep on going back
Even though it's me I abuse
I'll keep on going back
Even

I don't mind at all
Lean on my pride
Lean on my pride
I'm a lion
